Time to tackle the next slice. 

Carefully plan out the work required to achieve the stated goals. Create a detailed list of tasks to follow and present them to me for review before touching a single line of code.

Write your work plan to `docs/workplan-slice-{SLICE_NUMBER}.md`, ensuring it includes:

## Required Structure:
1. **Context Analysis** - What's already in place from previous slices, what needs to be added
2. **Detailed Task Breakdown** - Organized into logical phases with specific, actionable tasks
3. **Success Criteria Checklist** - Concrete checkpoints that can be validated
4. **Technical Decisions** - Key implementation choices with rationale
5. **Estimated Complexity** - Time/effort estimates per phase
6. **Reference Sections** - Relevant spec sections

## Format Requirements:
- Use markdown with clear hierarchy (headers, lists, checkboxes)
- Make it easy for an LLM to parse and use as a task list
- Include checkboxes for tracking progress (- [ ] for pending, - [x] for complete)
- Number tasks clearly and group related work into phases
- Add brief rationale for non-obvious technical decisions

Review the existing workplan files in `docs/` for formatting examples.
