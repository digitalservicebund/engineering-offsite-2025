- set lower autoscroll speed
- scale project circles with widthIncrement
- look into separating people & project labels a bit (maybe simply: alternating sides?)
- make event boxes wider to fit everything on two lines (investigate: can we do auto font-resizing if we go above two lines?)
- animation after final event: lanes merge + morph together, followed by huge fireworks / confetti
- animation after final event: zoom out to show the whole timeline
- make design less "flat"
- gentle parallax effect for background
